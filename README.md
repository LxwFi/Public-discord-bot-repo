# Info

## Purpose

This is just a personal project i work on in my free time, it has no real use apart from seeing what i can do

None of this is set in stone, and there is normally no planning ahead of time, i just wake up and think of things i want to do

###### Functionality

* osu!  
    * live updates for my (or any) account
    * user stat lookup
* twitter
    * live feed from selected accounts
* riot (WIP)
    * RiotID to name and vice versa
    * alot of stuff WIP
* ~~youtube~~
    * ~~music player~~
* More to come in the future

## Side notes

* The currency converter package has been modified by me to be more accurate
* The public repo gets updated almost never because this is intended to be for personal use
* Please read the code if you decide to clone it, if something isn't working it's probably using the wrong tokens/names

Started as a funny little side thing that i was inspired to do, and lead to a career in coding (Thank you Zach)
